For the course project, you will be studying thermo-chemical ammonia synthesis on metallic clusters and surfaces. Each student will be assigned one metal or bimetallic alloy. 

<a name='intro'></a>

## Introduction ##

The thermo-chemical ammonia synthesis reaction proceeds as:

$$
\begin{align}
\mathrm{N_{2\,(g)}} &\rightarrow \mathrm{2N*}\\\\
\mathrm{H_{2\,(g)}} &\rightarrow \mathrm{2H*}\\\\
\mathrm{N* + H*} &\rightarrow \mathrm{NH*}\\\\
\mathrm{NH* + H*} &\rightarrow \mathrm{NH_2*}\\\\
\mathrm{NH_2* + H*} &\rightarrow \mathrm{NH_{3\,(g)}}
\end{align}
$$

<a name='calcs'></a>

## Calculations ##

You are required to perform the following calculations:
1. Structural relaxations on both your assigned \\(M\_{13}\\) cluster and a \\( (111) \\) surface for the same metals. Check all possible sites in order to determine optimal adsorption configurations. Do this for all intermediates in the adsorbed state.

2. Fixed bond length (FBL) calculation for the activation barrier, for the most stable dissociated state only.

3. Vibrational analysis for the transition state

<a name='analysis'></a>

## Analysis ##

Your analysis should include the following:
* Discussion of the optimal binding configurations on the surface
* Analysis of rate as a function of the temperature

In addition, you may wish to address the following questions:
* Do the reaction intermediates (adsorbates) show the same dependence on surface site or surface termination?
* What are other factors that can affect adsorbate-metal interaction?
* How important is the coordination number of the metal? Compare the metal cluster to the metal surface.

You are welcome to share data amongst your peers to discuss broader trends. (Feel free to use Piazza so that everyone can use your data. You may also include additional calculations into your project (scripts available), but this is not required:
* Density of states calculations on the surfaces
* Error analysis using the BEEF ensembles

<a name='report'></a>

## Report ##

Your report should be between 3 to 5 pages long including figures and tables. Please be succinct and organize it in the following way:
Introduction (brief); Calculation details; Results and discussion; Conclusion (brief)

<a name='paper'></a>

## Research Paper ##

We expect that your results will form the basis of a manuscript that we will be putting together as a class. 

<a name='reqs'></a>
