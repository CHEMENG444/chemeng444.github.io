## Course Project
1. [Introduction](#intro)
2. [Calculations](#calcs)
3. [Summary of Requirements](#reqs)


For the course project, you will be studying thermochemical ammonia synthesis on metallic clusters and surfaces. Each student will be assigned one metal or bimetallic alloy. 

<a name='intro'></a>
## Introduction

The thermochemical ammonia synthesis reaction proceeds as:
$$
\begin{align}
\mathrm{N\_{2\,(g)}} &\rightarrow \mathrm{2N\*}\\\\
\mathrm{H\_{2\,(g)}} &\rightarrow \mathrm{2H\*}\\\\
\mathrm{N\* + H\*} &\rightarrow \mathrm{NH\*}\\\\
\mathrm{NH\* + H\*} &\rightarrow \mathrm{NH\_2\*}\\\\
\mathrm{NH\_2\* + H\*} &\rightarrow \mathrm{NH\_{3\,(g)}}
\end{align}
$$

## Calculations

You are required to perform the following calculations:
1. Structural relaxations on both your assigned \\(M\_{13}\\) cluster and a \\( (111) \\) surface for the same metals. Check all possible sites in order to determine optimal adsorption configurations. Do this for all intermediates in the adsorbed state.

2. Fixed bond length (FBL) calculation for the activation barrier, for the most stable dissociated state only.

3. Vibrational analysis for the transition state
