This website will contain information about the course project as well as some tutorials to help you along the way.

We will be using the [Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) with the [Quantum ESPRESSO calculator](https://github.com/vossjo/ase-espresso) through the [Sherlock computing cluster](http://sherlock.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. The tutorials covers the basics of using the UNIX shell, scripting in Python, and performing calculations with ASE.
