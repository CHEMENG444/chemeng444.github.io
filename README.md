This website will contain information about the course project as well as some tutorials to help you along the way.

We will be using the [Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) with the [ASE interface of the Quantum ESPRESSO calculator](http://github.com/vossjo/ase-espresso). Computer resources will be provided through the [Stanford Research Computing Center](https://srcc.stanford.edu/) and the Center for [Computational Earth  and Environmental Science (CEES)](http://http://cees.stanford.edu/index.php). The tutorials covers the basics of using the UNIX shell, scripting in Python, and performing calculations with ASE. As part of the final project requirements, you will be required to complete the exercises by their respective deadlines.
